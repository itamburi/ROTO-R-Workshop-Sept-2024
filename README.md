### Tutorial for getting set up with R / RStudio, learning coding fundamentals and basic data analysis!


* To get started, I reccomend downloading this repository to your computer
    * Click the green "Code" button, and in the drop-down click "Download ZIP", and simply uncompress the ZIP
* Within the "workshop" folder, you will find all relevant code, data and a pre-workshop PDF
    * Open this pre-workshop PDF, "ROTO Before the workshop guide.pdf", for instructions on how to install R and RStudio - or alternatively how to use RStudio via the web
* This pre-worshop PDF also breifly describes how to use and nagvigate the RStudio interface
* Lastly the PDF outlines what to expect in each section of the workshop
